            <h1>IEEE YP UK&I Postgraduate STEM Research Symposium</h1>
            <p>Hosted by the department of Computer Science, University of Chester</p>
          </div>
          <p>IEEE Young Professionals UK & Ireland and the department of Computer Science at the University of Chester cordially invite you to their inaugural postgraduate research STEM symposium. The symposium will take place at the University of Chester’s Parkgate Road campus from 28th-29th November 2018.</p>
          <p>This symposium creates an opportunity for early career researchers, especially postgraduate research students (PhD and MPhil), to present their research and receive feedback, share ideas, network in an environment that allows them to share their challenges and learn from others, learn about relevant research tools and skills, and explore the possibilities of turning their research to enterprise. It is a 2-day event targeting STEM based postgraduate researchers and postdocs, across the country and beyond.</p>
          <p>We are calling for submissions in the following categories:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Posters (A1 portrait)</li>
            <li>Papers (+ Oral presentations of 15 mins)</li>
            <li>Research to Enterprise Pitches</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It is not necessary to make a submission to attend the symposium.</p>

            <p>What's happening at the symposium?</p>
          </div>
          <p>The event focuses on research, enterprise and knowledge transfer and will comprise of presentations, workshops, keynotes, pitches, and awards.</p>
          <h3>Presentations</h3>
          <p>Participants are invited to submit  papers and posters on their research. The papers will be classified and presented through different tracks. This is not a peer reviewed conference – the idea here is to give participants the opportunity to discuss their research before an unfamiliar audience. A poster session will allow participants to interact with different researchers on their displayed research topics.</p>
          <h3>Workshops</h3>
          <p>Experts will deliver talks/training on LaTex, Research Methods, Research Tools, Shut up and Write (this has been hugely successful in helping PhD students in writing up stage), Research to Enterprise (a workshop on how to turn research to enterprise).</p>
          <h3>Research to Enterprise Pitches</h3>
          <p>Interested participants are invited to pitch their research to a select panel. The precis of the pitches will be made avialable to sponsoring companies, participants and through the IEEE UK & Ireland Young Professionals’ social media outlets for visibility (for possible sponsorship and collaboration).</p>
          <h3>Awards</h3>
          <p>The IEEE UK & Ireland Young Professionals is sponsoring Best Paper, Best Poster, and Best Research to Enterprise Pitch awards.</p>
          <h3>Reception</h3>
          <p>An optional reception with drinks and meals, providing a relaxing environment for meet-and-greet and networking. There is additional charge (to be advised) for the reception.</p>
